								 <h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR - <strong>JEFF CLARK</strong> </h2>
								 <p>Jeff Clark is the editor of the several investment advisories which focus on profiting from options in any market environment. For over 15 years, he edited two successful trading letters for Stansberry Research, The Short Report and Pro Trader. He developed the curricula for an international Masters of Business Administration (MBA) program and founded an investor education firm.   </p>
								 <p>Jeff uses the same strategy he recommends for his clients – around 100 of California’s wealthiest individuals. Jeff’s strategy allows you to potentially make money no matter what a stock does – whether it goes up, down, or just stays the same. That’s what makes him one of the best traders around. It’s also how he was able to retire when he was only 42 years old. </p>
								 <p>Since 2005, Jeff's subscribers have had the opportunity to make triple-digit gains over 50 times and 
								double-digit gains more than 160 times.</p>
